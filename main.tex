\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

\par
Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) is now the dominant method of making new soil maps.
%
DSM consists of training a model (either geostatistical or machine learning) on known observations, using their location and (for machine learning models) values of covariates at these locations.
%
The model is then applied over an area to be mapped, either by interpolation, by application of the machine-learning model, or a combination, to make a predictive map with quantified uncertainty at each location, typically a grid at some horizontal resolution.

\par
How useful are these maps? One answer is the per-grid cell evaluation of uncertianty, compared to acceptance criteria for one or more uses.
%
However, many uses require knowledge of the soil pattern, not just at individual points.
%
Except for precision agriculture, land is managed as units of more or less homogeneous soils, or at least a consistent pattern of contrasting soils.
%
Hydrologic models require connectivity between grid cells, as water flows over or through the landscape.

\section{What is ``Reality''?}

\par
Point-wise reality is the actual vertical distribution of a set of soil properties at pedon scale.
%
These are levels \textit{i} (pedon) and \textit{i-1} (horizon) of \citet{Hoosbeekquantitativemodelingpedogenesis1992}'s organizational hierarchy.
%
Finer scales are not mapped.

\subsection{Vertical reality}

DSM predicts either pointwise at fixed depths, or as averages over a fixed depth slice.
%
This contrasts with the organization of natural soil bodies as pedogenetic horizons, which are the usual vertical resolution units in field descriptions and laboratory analyses.


\subsection{Horizontal reality}
%

\par
The reality over areas includes the relation between pedons, i.e., polypedons of similar and contrasting soils.
%
The DSM product should show these relations.
%

\par
DSM predicts over grid cells much larger than a pedon.
%
Geostatistical methods can predict averages their uncertainties over a block the size of the grid cell, but the average is not observed in the field (unless the entire grid cell would be dug up for examination!).
%
Machine-learning methods predict at the same support as the training observations, i.e., ``point'' (pedon) support, and the predicted values and their uncertainties are implicity extended to the whole grid cell.
%
So here the reality is the average -- any finer-scale detail of reality is by definition not representable by this DSM.

\section{Concepts of spatial organization}

\par
The categorization spatial pattern of soil bodies was extensively studied over 50 years ago, notably by \citet{Fridland1972,Fridland1974} and \citet{holeApproachLandscapeAnalysis1978, holeSoilLandscapeAnalysis1985}.
%
Fridland defined ``soil combinations'', whereas Hole used the term ``soilscape fabrics''.
%

\subsection{Fridland's concepts}

\par
\citet{Fridland1974} explains that ``\emph{[s]oil combinations} consist of elementary soil areas which are \emph{genetically linked} to various degrees and which produce a \emph{definite pattern} in the soil mantle
%
\ldots
%
Multiple spatial repetition of a certain soil combination or several soil combinations alternating in a definite order creates various forms of structures of the soil mantle
%
\ldots
%
The initial indivisible component of the soil mantle is the \emph{elementary soil area} which represents a body of soil that belongs to a certain classificational unit of the lowest rank and occupies space which is bounded on all sides by other elementary soil areals or non-soil formation'' (emphasis added).

\par
At the finest scale these are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[0] Homogeneous
\item Sporadically spotted: ``minute'' areas of contrasting soils: e.g., from tree throw, termite mounds,  carbonate solution-driven  depth of pedogenesis
-- can be found by comprehensive geotechnical investigation or precision ag. technology; these DSM are not considered here
\item Regular-cycling: e.g.,  gilgai,
\item apparent diffusion
\end{enumerate}

The sporadically spotted scale can not be captured by any reasonable DSM scale.

He then defines local patterns related to geomorphic process, parent material, or pedologic processes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Dendritic, linear-dendritic and streaming forms, connected with various forms of the erosional relief;
\item  Rounded-spotted (including ringlike) forms, connected with various depressional forms (sink holes, depressions of different types and lakes) and hilly-morainic relief;
\item  Linear and wavy-linear forms connected with different linear forms of relief of an accumulative and somewhat erosional origin;
\item  Streak-phacoid forms (referring to \emph{Phacoides} bivalve shells)  characteristic of modern and ancient flood plains and deltas;
\item  A fan-shaped genetic and geometric structure is characteristic of alluvial fans and proluvial--deluvial trains;
\item A geometrically disordered structure of the soil mantle is usually conditioned by the heterogeneity of the soil-forming rocks and their irregular succession.
\end{enumerate}

If these local patterns are at sufficiently coarse size to be represented at the DSM resolution, we should see them on the DSM map.

\subsection{Hole's concepts}

\citet{holeSoilLandscapeAnalysis1985} relates the \emph{pedologic fabric} of the landscape in terms of the size, shape and arrangement of bodies of soil and associated not-soil.
%
These are all called \emph{associations}, depending on the size of mapping units on a polygon map of soil bodies.
%

\par
\citet[Table 5]{holeApproachLandscapeAnalysis1978} first discusses sizes of map units.
%
The soil individuals of map units as they exist on the ground are of size $\approx 1 \mathrm{m}^2$; this is the pedon.
%
These then can be grouped into polypedons:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Micro: $<0.1 \mathrm{ha}$;
\item Meso: $0.1 - 1.0 \mathrm{ha}$;
\item Macro: $10 - 100 \mathrm{ha}$;
\item Mega: $>100 \mathrm{ha}$;
\end{enumerate}
%
The resolution of the DSM product dictates which of these can be identified on the DSM map.

\par
Over larger extents, \citet[Table 5]{holeApproachLandscapeAnalysis1978} identifies:
%
``microassociation'' mapping units have size $<250 \mathrm{km}^2$;
%
``mesoasociation'' mapping units $250-2~500 \mathrm{km}^2$; and
%
``macroasociation'' mapping units  $2~500 - 250~000\mathrm{km}^2$.
%
``megaasociation'' mapping units  $> 250~000\mathrm{km}^2$.
%
These scales are not relevant to the current discussion.

\par
\citet[Figure 5]{holeApproachLandscapeAnalysis1978}  then discusses general categories of shapes of soil bodies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item disks
\item spots
\item stripes (simple or branched)
\item categorized by shape index (boundary length divided by periphery of a circle of the same area) as simple to rounded, and complex to angular.
\end{enumerate}
%
These can be identified at any resolution, depending on the spatial arrangement of the soil-forming process.

\section{Patterns represented by DSM}

\par
Different DSM methods can represent different patterns.

\begin{itemize}
\item Trend surfaces, including polynomial trends, thin-plate splines (TPS) and generalized additive models (GAM): These can represent smooth transitions over local to wide areas.  Splines and GAM show both in one model.
\item Interpolation by pure geostatistics, e.g., Ordinary Kriging (OK): These show smooth local transitions in the neighbourhood of training points. Thus they are well-suited to ``spots'' or ``disks''.
\item Tree-based or neural network-based machine learning: These predict separately at each grid cell, based on the trained model. There is no requirement for spatial continuity.  This allows finely-speckled patterns of contrasting soils -- whether these are realistic or not.
\end{itemize}


\section{Scale and resolution}

\par
The level of detail on a map has two components: categorical and cartographic.
%
Categorical detail is the precision of information. For a continuous variable it is the measurement precision.
%
For ordinal categorical variables generalized from continuous variables it is the class width.
%
For nominal categorical variables based on classes, e.g., a soil classification system, it is the extent of properties of the class.
%
This latter is implicit in monothetic hierarchical soil classification systems, notably USDA Soil Taxonomy, but also the World Reference Base for Soil Classification and many national systems.
