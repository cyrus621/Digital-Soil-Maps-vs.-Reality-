  abstract = {Initial units of the soil mantle are elementary soil areals which break up into three groups: homogeneous, sporadically spotted, and regular cyclic. Soil combinations consist of elementary soil areals which are genetically linked to various degrees and which produce a definite pattern in the soil mantle. These combinations are the smallest integral sectors of the structure of the mantle. Multiple spatial repetition of a certain soil combination or several soil combinations alternating in a definite order creates various forms of structures of the soil mantle. At the same time, soil combinations can be regarded as models of structures of the soil mantle. According to the character of genetic links between the components and the degree of contrast, the following six classes of soil combinations are singled out: complexes, spottinesses, catenas, variations, mosaics and tachets. Soil combinations are characterized by their composition, genetic and geometric forms, differentiation factors, history of development, degrees of stability, complexity and contrast. A classification of genetic and geometric forms of soil combinations is suggested which reflects the history of the soil mantle development and factors of its differentiation. The structure of the soil mantle is usually a multi-stage one, i.e., the simpler combinations constitute more complex ones. The study of the soil mantle structure provides the grounds for the elaboration of a system of cartographic units to show more completely and accurately the soil mantle on maps of different scales and purposes. The data on the structure of the soil mantle make it possible to effect more accurately all kinds of soil regionalization and predictions of the evolution of the soil mantle under natural conditions and under the influence of man.}

  abstract = {Principal components of landscape are defined. The soils portion is termed the landscape pedoplasma, distinct geographic subdivisions of which are called soilscapes. Some concepts of morphology and fabric of soil pedons are adapted for application to entire landscapes. Terminology and numerical indices are suggested for characterizing polypedons and multi-polypedonic units, including soilscapes, as to size, shape and arrangement of the geographic units, population density of polypedons per unit area, and pedologic diversity in terms of local relief, slope, and soil drainage conditions, and in taxonomic terms. Some results of application of specific methods of soilscape analysis to published soil and topographic maps are reported. Geographic trends in soilscape variability are found on a broad regional scale as well as in local landscapes. This approach to landscape analysis is deemed useful in systematizing the great volume of cartographic data of modern published soil surveys and may help in the location of sites for detailed pedogeomorphic and land use field studies.}

  abstract = {We introduce a novel method for classification and mapping of landform elements from a DEM based on the principle of pattern recognition rather than differential geometry. At the core of the method is the concept of geomorphon (geomorphologic phonotypes) --- a simple ternary pattern that serves as an archetype of a particular terrain morphology. A finite number of 498 geomorphons constitute a comprehensive and exhaustive set of all possible morphological terrain types including standard elements of landscape, as well as unfamiliar forms rarely found in natural terrestrial surfaces. A single scan of a DEM assigns an appropriate geomorphon to every cell in the raster using a procedure that self-adapts to identify the most suitable spatial scale at each location. As a result, the method classifies landform elements at a range of different spatial scales with unprecedented computational efficiency. A general purpose geomorphometric map --- an interpreted map of topography --- is obtained by generalizing allgeomorphons to a small number of the most common landform elements. Due to the robustness and high computational efficiency of the method high resolution geomorphometric maps having continental and even global extents can be generated from giga-cell DEMs. Such maps are a valuable new resource for both manual and automated geomorphometric analyses. In order to demonstrate a practical application of this new method, a 30 m cell- 1 geomorphometric map of the entire country of Poland is generated and the features and potential usage of this map are briefly discussed. The computer implementation of the method is outlined. The code is available in the public domain.},

  abstract = {Geospatial Pattern Analysis Toolbox (GeoPAT) is a collection of GRASS GIS modules for carrying out pattern-based geospatial analysis of images and other spatial datasets. The need for pattern-based analysis arises when images/rasters contain rich spatial information either because of their very high resolution or their very large spatial extent. Elementary units of pattern-based analysis are scenes -- patches of surface consisting of a complex arrangement of individual pixels (patterns). GeoPAT modules implement popular GIS algorithms, such as query, overlay, and segmentation, to operate on the grid of scenes. To achieve these capabilities GeoPAT includes a library of scene signatures -- compact numerical descriptors of patterns, and a library of distance functions -- providing numerical means of assessing dissimilarity between scenes. Ancillary GeoPAT modules use these functions to construct a grid of scenes or to assign signatures to individual scenes having regular or irregular geometries. Thus GeoPAT combines knowledge retrieval from patterns with mapping tasks within a single integrated GIS environment. GeoPAT is designed to identify and analyze complex, highly generalized classes in spatial datasets. Examples include distinguishing between different styles of urban settlements using VHR images, delineating different landscape types in land cover maps, and mapping physiographic units from DEM. The concept of pattern-based spatial analysis is explained and the roles of all modules and functions are described. A case study example pertaining to delineation of landscape types in a subregion of NLCD is given. Performance evaluation is included to highlight GeoPAT's applicability to very large datasets. The GeoPAT toolbox is available for download from http://sil.uc.edu/.},

  abstract = {Analyzing large Earth Observation (EO) data on the broad spatial scales frequently involves regionalization of patterns. To automate this process we present a segmentation algorithm designed specifically to delineate segments containing quasi-stationary patterns. The algorithm is designed to work with patterns of a categorical variable. This makes it possible to analyze very large spatial datasets (for example, a global land cover) in their entirety. An input categorical raster is first tessellated into small square tiles to form a new, coarser, grid of tiles. A mosaic of categories within each tile forms a local pattern, and the segmentation algorithm partitions the grid of tiles while maintaining the cohesion of pattern in each segment. The algorithm is based on the principle of seeded region growing (SRG) but it also includes segment merging and other enhancements to segmentation quality. Our key contribution is an extension of the concept of segmentation to grids in which each cell has a non-negligible size and contains a complex data structure (histograms of pattern features). Specific modification of a standard SRG algorithm include: working in a distance space with complex data objects, introducing six-connected "brick wall" topology of the grid to decrease artifacts associated with tessellation of geographical space, constructing the SRG priority queue of seeds on the basis of local homogeneity of patterns, and using a content-dependent value of segment-growing threshold. The detailed description of the algorithm is given followed by an assessment of its performance on test datasets representing three pertinent themes of land cover, topography, and a high-resolution image. Pattern-based segmentation algorithm will find application in ecology, forestry, geomorphology, land management, and agriculture. The algorithm is implemented as a module of GeoPAT - an already existing, open source toolbox for performing pattern-based analysis of categorical rasters.},

  abstract = {We present and evaluate a quantitative method for delineation of ecophysiographic regions throughout the entire terrestrial landmass. The method uses the new pattern-based segmentation technique which attempts to emulate the qualitative, weight-of-evidence approach to a delineation of ecoregions in a computer code. An ecophysiographic region is characterized by homogeneous physiography defined by the cohesiveness of patterns of four variables: land cover, soils, landforms, and climatic patterns. Homogeneous physiography is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a region to be an ecoregion, thus machine delineation of ecophysiographic regions is the first, important step toward global ecoregionalization. In this paper, we focus on the first-order approximation of the proposed method -- delineation on the basis of the patterns of the land cover alone. We justify this approximation by the existence of significant spatial associations between various physiographic variables. Resulting ecophysiographic regionalization (ECOR) is shown to be more physiographically homogeneous than existing global ecoregionalizations (Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEW) and Bailey's Ecoregions of the Continents (BEC)). The presented quantitative method has an advantage of being transparent and objective. It can be verified, easily updated, modified and customized for specific applications. Each region in ECOR contains detailed, SQL-searchable information about physiographic patterns within it. It also has a computer-generated label. To give a sense of how ECOR compares to TEW and, in the U.S., to EPA Level III ecoregions, we contrast these different delineations using two specific sites as examples. We conclude that ECOR yields regionalization somewhat similar to EPA level III ecoregions, but for the entire world, and by automatic means.},

Many methods for calculating such associations have been proposed, but the case when both variables are categorical is underdeveloped despite the fact that many datasets of interest are in the form of either regionalizations or thematic maps. In this paper, we advance this case by adapting the so-called -measure method from its original information-theoretical formulation to the analysis of variance formulation which provides more insight for spatial analysis. We present a step-by-step derivation of the -measure from the perspective of the analysis of variance. The method produces three indices of global association and two sets of local association indicators which could be mapped to indicate spatial distribution of association strength. The open-source software for calculating all indices from vector datasets accompanies the paper. To showcase the utility of the -measure, we identified three different application contexts: comparative, associative, and derivative, and present an example of each of them. The -measure method has several advantages over the widely used Mapcurves method, it has clear interpretations in terms of mutual information as well as in terms of analysis of variance, it provides more precise assessment of association, it is ready-to-use through the accompanying software, and the examples given in the paper serves as a guide to the gamut of its possible applications. Two specific contributions stemming from our re-analysis of the -measure are the finding of the conceptual flaw in the Geographical Detector---a method to quantify associations between numerical and categorical spatial variables, and a proposal for the new, cartographically based algorithm for finding an optimal number of regions in clustering-derived regionalizations.},

The methods are illustrated with an example, i.e. topsoil pH for an area in central New York state. A companion report examines other areas, soil properties, and depth intervals. A set of R Markdown scripts is referenced so that readers can apply the analysis for areas of their interest. For the test case, we discover and discuss substantial discrepancies between DSM products and large differences between the DSM products and legacy field surveys. These differences are in whole-map statistics, visually identifiable landscape features, level of detail, range and strength of spatial autocorrelation, landscape metrics (Shannon diversity and evenness, shape, aggregation, mean fractal dimension, and co-occurrence vectors), and spatial patterns of property maps classified by histogram equalization. Histograms and variogram analysis revealed the smoothing effect of machine learning models. Property class maps made by histogram equalization were substantially different, but there was no consistent trend in their landscape metrics. The model using only national points and covariates was not substantially different from the global model and, in some cases, introduced artefacts from a lithology covariate. Uncertainty (5 \%--95 \% confidence intervals) provided by SoilGrids and POLARIS were unrealistically wide compared to gNATSGO/gSSURGO low and high estimated values and show substantially different spatial patterns. We discuss the potential use of the DSM products as a (partial) replacement for field-based soil surveys. There is no substitute for actually examining and interpreting the soil--landscape relation, but despite the issues revealed in this study, DSM can be an important aid to the soil surveyor.},

Despite advancements in digital soil mapping and initiatives like GlobalSoilMap, quantifying soil variability and its uncertainty across space, depth and time remains a challenge. Therefore, maps of key soil properties are often still missing on a national scale, which is also the case in the Netherlands. To meet this challenge and fill this data gap, we introduce BIS-4D, a high-resolution soil modeling and mapping platform for the Netherlands. BIS-4D delivers maps of soil texture (clay, silt and sand content), bulk density, pH, total nitrogen, oxalate-extractable phosphorus, cation exchange capacity and their uncertainties at 25 m resolution between 0 and 2 m depth in 3D space. Additionally, it provides maps of soil organic matter and its uncertainty in 3D space and time between 1953 and 2023 at the same resolution and depth range. The statistical model uses machine learning informed by soil observations amounting to between 3815 and 855 950, depending on the soil property, and 366 environmental covariates. We assess the accuracy of mean and median predictions using design-based statistical inference of a probability sample and location-grouped 10-fold cross validation (CV) and prediction uncertainty using the prediction interval coverage probability.  We found that the accuracy of clay, sand and pH maps was the highest, with the model efficiency coefficient (MEC) ranging between 0.6 and 0.92 depending on depth. Silt, bulk density, soil organic matter, total nitrogen and cation exchange capacity (MEC of 0.27 to 0.78), and especially oxalate-extractable phosphorus (MEC of -0.11 to 0.38) were more difficult to predict. One of the main limitations of BIS-4D is that prediction maps cannot be used to quantify the uncertainty in spatial aggregates. We provide an example of good practice to help users decide whether BIS-4D is suitable for their intended purpose. An overview of all maps and their uncertainties can be found in the Supplement. Openly available code and input data enhance reproducibility and help with future updates. BIS-4D prediction maps can be readily downloaded at https://doi.org/10.4121/0c934ac6-2e95-4422-8360-d3a802766c71 (Helfenstein et al., 2024a). BIS-4D fills the previous data gap of the national-scale GlobalSoilMap product in the Netherlands and will hopefully facilitate the inclusion of soil spatial variability as a routine and integral part of decision support systems.},

  abstract = {This tutorial describes both the theory and practice of the use of Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textures as originally described by Haralick and others in 1973. It leads users through the practical construction and use of a small sample image, with the aim of deep understanding of the purpose, capabilities and limitations of this set of descriptive statistics. Explanations and examples are concentrated on use in a landscape scale and perspective for enhancing classification accuracy, particularly in the cases where spatial arrangement of tonal (spectral) variability provides independent data relevant to the class identification. Background information is provided to answer the questions arising from 15 years of use of the tutorial, and increased practical experience of the author in teaching and research. Some information is provided to make the material accessible to specialists in fields other than remote sensing, for example medical imaging and industrial quality control. However the author is not an expert in these fields and texture's use there is not covered in detail. A basic bibliography is provided for research that has promoted the field of remote sensing GLCM texture; research projects that simply make use of it are not systematically covered.},

  abstract = {Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) products are simplified representations of more complex and partially unknown patterns of soil variations. Therefore, any prediction of a soil property that can be derived from these products has an irreducible uncertainty that needs to be mapped. The objective of this study was to compare the most current DSM method - Regression Kriging (RK) - with a new approach derived from RandomForest - Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) - in regard to their ability of predicting the uncertainties of GlobalSoilMap soil property grids. The comparison was performed for three soil properties, pH, organic carbon and clay content at 5-15 cm depth in a 27,236 km(2) Mediterranean French region with sparse sets of measured soil profiles (1/13.5 km(2)) and for a set of environmental covariates characterizing the relief, climate, geology and land use of the region. Apart from classical performance indicators, comparisons involved accuracy plots and the visual examinations of the uncertainty maps provided by the two methods. The results obtained for the three soil properties showed that QRF provided more accurate and more interpretable predicted patterns of uncertainty than RK did, while having similar performances in predicting soil properties. The use of QRF in operational DSM is therefore recommended, especially when spatial sampling of soil observations are too sparse for applying RK. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The quantitative evaluation showed metrics in line with previous global, continental and large-region studies. The qualitative evaluation showed that coarse-scale patterns are well reproduced.

  abstract = {One of the great difficulties in soil classification is that soils rarely exist as discrete individuals with clear boundaries. Instead, they grade to other soils across broad transition belts and their boundaries are determined by definition. Two new concepts, the pedon and the soil individual, have been proposed to help clarify relations between the soil continuum and soil taxonomic classes. Pedons are real, natural soil volumes just large enough to show all the soil horizons present and their relationships. Boundaries of pedons do not depend on reference to any taxonomic scheme. A soil individual (polypedon) is also a real soil body; it is a parcel of contiguous pedons all of which have characteristics lying within the defined limits of a single soil series. Pedons may be considered as building blocks that make up both soil taxonomic classes and soil mapping units. Most pedons are too small to exhibit all the characteristics of a soil individual; for example, usually they do not show shape of the soil nor nature of its boundaries with other soils. Soil individuals (polypedons) are the subject of soil taxonomy; they are the real objects that are classified. They are comparable to individual pine trees, individual fish, and individual men.},

It has been widely adopted and applied in soil survey and continues to be of great value in soil and other field sciences The concept characterises widespread patterns in which distinctive associations of soils and vegetation are consistently located in specific slope positions. The formalisation of the concept in an area well outside the mainstream of soil research appears to have been due to the combination of highly visible recurrent patterns of red slope soils overlooking dark valley clays in East Africa's extensive savannahs, together with a group of receptive and collaborative soil scientists working in a supportive institutional environment. The concept is often attributed to Geoffrey Milne, the group's coordinator, but we show that several colleagues and friends also contributed. We summarise some of the early soil catenas characterised by Milne and his colleagues in Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika Territory (now Tanzania). Even at the beginning, it was appreciated that the catena was not universally applicable and that heterogeneity of parent materials can override catenary patterns. The catena was quickly and widely adopted in soil science, and this diffusion has led to some broadening of the definition, and several types of soil pattern are now designated as catenas. The concept has also spread beyond soil science and is used by ecologists, geomorphologists and hydrologists amongst others. It continues to be a paradigm of great explicative and educational power in soil science and ecology.},

  abstract = {Converting an image to a set of superpixels is a useful preprocessing step in many computer vision applications; it reduces the dimensionality of the data and removes noise. The most popular superpixels algorithm is the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC). To use original SLIC with non-imagery data (for example, rasters of discrete probability distributions, time-series, or matrices describing local texture or pattern), the data needs to be converted to the false-color RGB image constructed from the first three principal components. Here we propose to extend the SLIC algorithm so it can work with non-imagery data structures without data reduction and conversion to the false-color image. The modification allows for using a data distance measure most appropriate to a particular data structure and for using a custom function for averaging values of clusters centers. Comparisons between the extended and original SLIC algorithms in three different mapping tasks are presented and discussed. The results show that the extended SLIC improves the accuracy of the final products in reverse proportion to the percentage of variability explained by the three-dimensional (RGB) approximation to multidimensional non-imagery data. Thus, the largest advantage of using the modified SLIC can be expected in applications to data that cannot be compressed to three dimensions without a significant departure from its original variability.},

We discuss the various methods that have been, or could be, used for fitting quantitative relationships between soil properties or classes and their 'environment'. These include generalised linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems and geostatistics. We also review the data layers that have been, or could be, used to describe the 'environment'. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models, and spectral reflectance bands from satellite imagery, have been the most commonly used, but there is a large potential for new data layers. The generic framework, which we call the scorpan-SSPFe (soil spatial prediction function with spatially autocorrelated errors) method, is particularly relevant for those places where soil resource information is limited. It is based on the seven predictive scorpan factors, a generalisation of Jenny's five factors, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position. Interactions (*) between these factors are also considered. The scorpan-SSPFe method essentially involves the following steps: (i) Define soil attribute(s) of interest and decide resolution [rho] and block size [beta].(ii) Assemble data layers to represent Q.(iii) Spatial decomposition or lagging of data layers.(iv) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites.(v) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data.(vi) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham's razor) with autocorrelated errors.(vii) Predict digital map.(viii) Field sampling and laboratory analysis for corroboration and quality testing.(ix) If necessary, simplify legend or decrease resolution by returning to (i) or improve map by returning to (v).Finally, possible applications, problems and improvements are discussed.}

  abstract = {Forested hillslopes are zones of specific surface hydrology and geomorphic activity regimes. Their distinct properties, namely terrain microrelief ({$<$}10~m in diameter and height), are often a result of past disturbances that control forest stand conditions, soil formation processes, and superficial processes. A clear bioindicator of the past forest disturbance is pit-mound topography, which, however, is challenging to study because of its complexity and relatively small sizes of individual forms (usually {$<$}5~m in diameter). The present study analyzed the spatial representation, geomorphometric, and geophysical evaluation of the rare pit-mound topography in the Karkonosze Mountains National Park, SW Poland, Central Europe. For this task, two digital terrain models (DTMs) have been considered and were based on different quality point clouds collected during airborne and terrestrial laser scanning (ALS and TLS, respectively). The first data allowed the production of the DTM in 1~{\texttimes}~1~m spatial resolution, while the second data offered the DTM in 0.025~{\texttimes}~0.025~m resolution. Various geomorphometric derivatives (Terrain Ruggedness Index, Geomorphons, Topographic Wetness Index, Valley Depth, and Negative Openness) were applied and compared based on these models. In the further part of the study, we applied electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and electromagnetic induction (EMI), assisted by shallow soil sampling and analyses to support the interpretation of geophysical models. Our TLS-based DTM offered higher-quality models and a better representation of pit-mound topography. The high-quality TLS-based DTM elevation model can support close-to-reality hydrological and geomorphic modeling. The geophysical investigation allowed us to isolate a critical difference between treethrow pits and mounds better represented by ERT models than shallow EMI models. The differences were partly supported by soil properties, namely lower electrical resistivity in treethrow pits were related to higher moisture conditions, organic matter, organic carbon, and silt content in pits. As a general property, pit-mound topography resulting from tree uprooting adds to the complexity of forested hillslope hydrology and geomorphic activity. The surficial heterogeneity in hillslope topography was also evident in soil properties with sharp changes in short distances between treethrow mounds and pits.},

A systematic search and screening procedure, largely following the RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES) protocol, was carried out. It yielded a database of 188 peer-reviewed DSM studies from the past two decades, all written in English and all presenting a raster map of a continuous soil property. Review of the full texts showed that most publications (97\%) included some type of map validation, while just over one-third (35\%) estimated map uncertainty. Most commonly, a combination of multiple (existing) soil sampling data was used and the resulting maps were validated by single data-splitting or cross-validation. It was also common for essential information to be lacking in method descriptions. This is unfortunate, as lack of information on sampling design (missing in 25\% of 188 studies) and sample support (missing in 45\% of 188 studies) makes it difficult to interpret what derived validation metrics represent, compromising their usefulness. Therefore, we present a list of method details that should be provided in DSM studies. We also provide a detailed summary of the 28 validation metrics used in published DSM studies, how to interpret the values obtained, and whether the metrics can be compared between datasets or soil attributes.},

The water content of soil plays an important role in many ecological and hydrological processes for land suitability evaluation. In this study we present a flexible procedure to interpolate soil-related variables that uses covariates to estimate the spatial trend of the variables and quantifies the uncertainty dealing with non-linear relationships. The procedure further extends approaches based on generalized additive models. The use of Gaussian simulations of the error allows the assessment of spatial uncertainty. The method was applied to available soil water capacity for three different nested extents: national, regional, and catchment. The models fitted have different significant covariates and different estimated values according to the region considered. The results suggest that the estimates from the model fitted at the appropriate extent are the most accurate. Taking into account the uncertainty of the trend, the results provided a realistic estimation of the variability and they are spatially consistent with the geomorphological patterns. Estimating the variability with the proposed procedure is useful for further environmental and land use modelling and it can be integrated with uncertainty from other variables, such as those derived from climate models.},

  abstract = {Detailed soil property maps are increasingly important for land management decisions and environmental modeling. The US Soil Survey is investing in production of the Soil Landscapes of the United States (SOLUS), a new set of national predictive soil property maps. This paper documents initial 100-m resolution maps of 20 soil properties that include various textural fractions, physical parameters, chemical parameters, carbon, and depth to restrictions. Many of these properties have not been previously mapped at this resolution. A hybrid training strategy helped increase training data by roughly 10-fold over previous similar studies by combining commonly used laboratory data with underutilized field descriptions tied to soil survey map unit component property estimates (to help represent within polygon variability) as well as randomly selected soil survey map unit weighted average property estimates. Relative prediction intervals were used to help select which training data sources improved model performance. Conventional and spatial cross-validation strategies yielded generally strong coefficients of determination between 0.5 and 0.7, but with substantial variability and outliers among the various properties, types of training data, and depths. Internal review of the maps highlighted both strengths and weaknesses of the maps, but most of the critical comments were in areas with high model uncertainty that can be used to guide future improvements. Generally, previously glaciated areas and complex large alluvial basins were harder to model. The new SOLUS 100-m maps will be updated in the future to address identified issues and feedback as users interact with the data.},

  abstract = {The formation of drumlins remains a major enigma. It is accepted that drumlins form under active temperate ice most likely within a soft sediment deforming bed at ephemeral `sticky points'. These `sticky points' likely lead to the causative mechanism around which sediment nucleation occurs. The critical question is under what conditions and where and how do `sticky spots' form. A comparative investigation of a drumlin and mega-flute in the New York Drumlin Field, as a case study, demonstrates that rheological and sedimentological tills from these different forms are similar. It is not, therefore, rheological change alone that must account for drumlin shape and form but likely the advective subglacial basal sediment flux rate at the ice bed. The rate of sediment motion between the upper interface at the ice--sediment bed boundary, and the lower immobile sediment at depth is crucial. At the lower d{\'e}collement between the mobile and immobile sediment units, within the deforming sediment package, proto-drumlin nucleation is likely to occur and develop into a streamlined form. The trigger mechanism for such a perturbation is a derivative of sediment rheology and sediment flux rate driven by the overlying ice stresses. Recent evidence from Antarctica lends credence to this new hypothesis that can be related to all drumlins formed under temperate, soft sediment deforming bed conditions.},

  abstract = {The historical development of our pedogenetic model is reviewed, and trends or directions toward the future are discussed. Pedogenetic models are characterized with respect to relative degree of computation, complexity, and level of organization. These three characteristics are used as a framework for classification. Early qualitative models have well served the purpose of soil survey to describe the distribution of soils in landscapes. Further development of qualitative models will contribute to the understanding of soil genesis in areas where soil surveys are not completed. In the developed countries, however, the scientific questions have changed dramatically. Greater interest lies in understanding the physical and chemical processes of soil formation acting within relatively short time frames and assessing the interactions between natural processes and environmental change or anthropogenic impacts. Quantification of pedogenetic processes is a life-line to other environmental disciplines, and a mechanistic understanding would, in an ideal situation, describe and predict the behavior of a system for a limited number of years under changing environmental conditions. A proposed approach to mathematical simulation of the dynamic pedogenetic processes is to integrate soil physical, chemical, and other ecological system models into a quantitative pedogenetic model. Models may be developed as research tools in data-intensive studies at the pedon or horizon level, or for the purpose of simulating a soil system at the catena or soil region level. Specific kinds of pedogenetic models have specific implications with respect to the availability and spatial variability of the data needed for development and testing.}

  abstract = {Pixels, blocks of pixels, and polygons are all potentially viable spatial assessment units for conducting an accuracy assessment. We develop a population-based statistical framework to examine how the spatial unit chosen affects the outcome of an accuracy assessment. The population is conceptualized as a difference map created by overlaying a complete coverage reference classification and the target map being evaluated. The per-class areas of agreement and disagreement derived from this population are summarized by a population error matrix and accuracy parameters (e.g., overall, user's and producer's accuracies). The population and values of the accuracy parameters are strongly affected by the protocols implemented for the response design which include the choice of spatial unit, how within-unit homogeneity is addressed when assigning class labels, and the definition of agreement between the reference and map classification. Several complete coverage populations are used to illustrate how accuracy results are affected by the spatial unit chosen for the assessment and also to evaluate how spatial misregistration of the map and reference locations impacts accuracy results for different spatial units. The sampling design implemented for accuracy assessment does not change the population or values of the accuracy parameters, but the choice of spatial unit will influence decisions regarding use of strata and clusters in the design. A universally best spatial assessment unit does not exist, so it is critical to recognize how the population, values of the accuracy parameters, and sampling design are impacted by the choice of spatial unit.},

  abstract = {A geographical information system (GIS) or expert knowledge-based fuzzy soil inference scheme (soil-land inference model, SoLIM) is described. The scheme consists of three major components: (i) a model employing a similarity representation of soils, (ii) a set of inference techniques for deriving the similarity representation, and (iii) use of the similarity representation. The similarity representation allows the soil landscape to be considered as a continuum, and thereby overcomes the generalization of soils in conventional soil mapping. The set of inference techniques is based on the soil factor equation and the soil-landscape model. The soil-landscape concept contends that if one knows the relationships between each soil and its environment for an area, then one is able to infer what soil might be at each location on the landscape by assessing the environmental conditions at that point. Under the SoLIM, soil environmental conditions over an area are characterized using GIS or remote sensing techniques. The relationships between soils and their formative environmental conditions are extracted from local soil experts or from field observations using a set of artificial intelligence techniques. The characterized environmental conditions are then combined with the extracted relationships to derive a similarity representation of soils over an area. It is demonstrated through two case studies that the SoLIM for soil survey has many advantages over the conventional soil survey approach. Soil information products derived through the SoLIM are of high quality in terms of both level of spatial detail and degree of attribute accuracy. In addition, the scheme shows promise for improving the efficiency of soil survey and subsequent updates through reducing time and costs of conducting a survey. However, the degree of success of the SoLIM highly depends on the availability and quality of environmental data, and the quality of knowledge on soil-environmental relationships over the study area.}

  abstract = {Detailed information on the spatial variation of soils is desirable for many agricultural and environmental applications. This research explores three approaches that use soil fuzzy membership values to predict detailed spatial variation of soil properties. The first two are weighted average models with which the soil property value at a location is the average of the typical soil property values of the soil types weighted by fuzzy membership values. We compared two options to determine the typical property values: one that uses the representative values from existing soil survey and the other that uses the property value of a field observation typical of a soil type. The third approach is a multiple linear regression in which the soil property value at a location is predicted using a regression between the soil property and fuzzy membership values. We compared this to multiple linear regression with environmental variables. In a case study in the Driftless Area of Wisconsin, the models were also compared with a predictive model based on existing soil survey. The results showed that regression with environmental variables works well for areas where the soil-terrain relationship is relatively simple but regression with fuzzy membership values is an improvement for areas where soil-terrain relationships are more complicated. From the perspectives of data requirement and model simplicity as well as accuracy of prediction the weighted average with maximum fuzzy membership option has obvious advantages.},
