# DSM vs. "reality"

DSM products have been evaluated by their point evaluation statistics, yet the map is used spatially so that connectivity, adjacency, patches etc. are important. In addition we would like the DSM product to give an impression of the soil geography.

This paper examines how well a DSM product corresponds to the "actual" soil cover. This is greatly influenced by the cartographic scale being "reproduced" vs. the resolution of the DSM product. It is also influenced by the caegorical detail.
